Features:

List of exercises:
    - Create
    - Read
    - Update
    - Delete

This is the basis, it will be persisted with sqlite to start, then 
migrate to postgresql.

Basically just a form and a list view initially.

Soon bringing in auth will allow exercises that already exist to 
be searched and added to a user's profile/set of exercises.

Eventually, the idea is to be able to program workouts with the set
exercises and schedule them out, repeat schedules, etc.

So I need a data schema for exercises. The SQL will look like:

CREATE TABLE exercises (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT,
    description TEXT,
    hyperlink TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP
);
